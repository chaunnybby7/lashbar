# lashbar

In this mini-project, I have built a landing page using HTML and CSS. 
I decided to go with a Lash Extensions Salon named Chaunette Lash.
The website is a pink color themed minimalistic design. 
Typography is extremely important for me and I have also used a chic font named 'Abel' for this website. 

## Instructions

* As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the page uses semantic HTML elements.

* It's done when the page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

* It's done when the page features at least three colors in the design.

* It's done when the page uses a single font and font family for all text.

* It's done when the page uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).

* It's done when the header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

* It's done when the header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.

* It's done when, if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

* It's done when the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.

* It's done when the contact form includes a Send button.

* It's done when the image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.

* It's done when the page is deployed to GitHub Pages.

# What have I done on this website:

Step 1: Created a landing page called Chaunette Lash Bar. 

Step 2: Used a class named hero on style.css to place background-image at the header of the webpage, instead of using `img` tag to insert image on index.html. 

Step 3: Created container using div class to write text(tagline) over the background image. 

Step 4: Created a content class for body section of the webpage to style the texts.
There's a short About Us message and menu of services with pricing information. 

Step 5: There is a contact form at the bottom of the page.

Step 6: Customized the form attributes by declaring element id on style css, and adding styles like the font family and font size. 

Step 7: Created link tabs on the navigation bar on the top right hand corner of the webpage.
When user clicks on any of the tabs, it jumps directly to each section at the body of the webpage, such as About Us, Services and Contact Us. 

Step 8: Downloaded 'Abel' font and linked the stylesheet on index.html file. Used this font for the body and footer texts.

Step 9: Embedded Calendly application for appointment scheduling. 

Step 10: Added disclaimer, instructions and pricing info on the Calendly page to inform users of important messages.
