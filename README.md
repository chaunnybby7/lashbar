# lashbar

In this mini-project, I have built a landing page using HTML and CSS. 
I decided to go with a Lash Extensions Salon named Chaunette Lash.
The website is a pink color themed minimalistic design. 
Typography is extremely important for me and I have also used a chic font named 'Abel' for this website. 

## Instructions

* As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the page uses semantic HTML elements.

* It's done when the page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

* It's done when the page features at least three colors in the design.

* It's done when the page uses a single font and font family for all text.

* It's done when the page uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).

* It's done when the header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

* It's done when the header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.

* It's done when, if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

* It's done when the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.

* It's done when the contact form includes a Send button.

* It's done when the image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.

* It's done when the page is deployed to GitHub Pages.

# What have I done on this website:

- Created a landing page called Chaunette Lash Bar.
- There's a header picture that takes up 100% width at the top of the page. 
- There's a short introduction on the page.
- There's a menu of services with pricing information.
- There is a form at the bottom of the page.
- Customized the form attributes by changing the font family and font size. 
- There are three links on the navigation bar. When user clicks on the tabs, it jumps directly to each section, such as About Us, Services and Contact Us. 
- Downloaded 'Abel' font and used it for the body and footer texts.
- Inserted and aligned text/slogan over the header photo.
- Embedded Calendly for appointment scheduling. 
- Added disclaimer, instructions and pricing info on the Calendly page to inform users of important messages.
